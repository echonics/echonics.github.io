    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The past last weeks I was working on cpuple of projects which one of them was a Tricopter, and some how I had to charge my LiPo Batteries as i did not have a lipo charger since I spent all of my money on rest of the parts and my 3D printer.
I did temp use some PCB from an old power bank to charge my batteries ( the power bank was based on a 3S LiPo ) but my batteries would get unbalanced over time as its not a balance charger ( balancing was done by the BMS on the battery itself ).
It was actually the time to get working on a DIY Lipo charger which I can build with parts I can source locally / parts I already have.
I started looking over internet but every single DIY charger I found was eaither unbalnced, 3 seperate chargers for every cell or based on some special IC i cant get my hands on, so why not design one my self ?
started by writing a list of required and optional features i wanned :</p>

<p>Required :</p>

<pre><code>* atleast 1S-3S
* atleast 2.5A charger power
* digital ( AVR Based )
* balnced charging ( obviously )
* Battery discharging and capacity testing
* LCD Screen interface
</code></pre>

<p>Optional :</p>

<pre><code>* 4S ?
* support for other types of batteries other than LI-Po/Ion
* 3A charge power
</code></pre>

<p>Looks like a long list buti wanned something i can depend on, i can my goal set .. so i got started :D</p>
